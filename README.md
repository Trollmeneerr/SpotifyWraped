# Phasmophobia SaveFile viewer
This was a litle side project as i didn't see any other savefile viewer include this much info without having to downloading the decrypted savefile and look trough it your self.
This is all my code feel free to fork and improve my code or use it for your own project, if you look at the source code and think OMG what a mess, it is a mess. It free and i will improve it in the future.
U can't edit your save file because that is CHEATING and is not condened.
If you want here to edit your safe file, you are a scumbag and should be banned from the game forever.
